    edited to csv by hand. They are lat long, not UTM
    Site Location: Fifteen sites (3 in each of 5 ecosystem types) were selected for monitoring of NPP. Sites and locations summarized here: Based on UTM Zone 13, Datum WGS84 Site lat (north) long (west)

    note, has potentially important info on observations made but not recorded when everything was dormant
    nope, nm, when something was dormant it was recorded the same as the prior month. and it's mostly the low diversity playa (zone P) sites
