Uniforc, GDD, & Alternating models almost always the best ones

In addition to [something something ecology] our analysis provides guidance on which models to use in a given scenario. For example, if models built with data from a large spatial extent to make predictions at single sites (eg. using USA-NPN derived models to make predictions at LTER locations) our results show that the Alternating model is the best option, as performance under this scenario is very similar to performance of Alternating models built from LTS data (Fig. 3). In the opposite scenario of making large-scale predictions using only data from a single site (eg. using LTER derived models to make predictions at USA-NPN locations) the Fixed GDD model is likely the best option, as most LTS derived Fixed GDD models have a RMSE only 5 days greater, on average, than the corresponding NPN model (Fig. 4). The Alternating model is also one of the best performing model overall for large-scale NPN data (Fig. 3a).
